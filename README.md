# Classification
I know there's alot of blogs and acticles about what classification problem is in machine learning.  
this read me won't compite with those acticle to drive the best way you could understand classification but contribute to those acticle to give you options.  
Am not a writer and I don't expect to write the best piece but I promise i will try my best for your option collections.
Classification problem is when you are trying to predict a class or label in a given dataset.  
A good example of Classification problem is this repo. the provided data has columns and there's an important column labelled "outcome" thats the column we're trying to predict

### Real Life Problem
is many cases the client you're working for or the project you're working on expect you to label the columns and identify the problem statement on your own. I know many Love advice will say follow your heart and don't let you head get in the way, well this is the opposite. But don't worry when a client expect you to define the problem statement you've already above the data science ladder and it will be a piece of cake.  
For those who are finding hard to grasp don't worry I will walk you though this repo.

##### Downloading the data
click Healthcare - Diabetes.zip file then click download button on the far right, incase for some reason you can't download click view raw.  
  
##### Understanding the problem statement
To make it easy for you it's classification problem.  
How did i know it? it's very simply, whenever you're working on a data that has a class or label and you're acquired to use that class to predict then that's a classification problem. popular examples are spam detection, fraud detection, customer churn prediction and many more.  
There two types of Classification problem;
                                          1. Binary classification - it's when you have only two class to predict i.e predicting if someone is Short or Tall 
                                          2. Multi- class - it's when you have more than two class to predict i.e predicting  if someone is Short, Medium or Tall.
###### Look Out For.
In some cases people confuse classification problem with clustering problem, Clustering problem may look similar to classification problem but if the data in hand doesn't label the value you want to predict then it's not classification use case. Clustering algorithm is sometimes used as feature engineering for classification use cases. a good blog to look into https://towardsdatascience.com/cluster-then-predict-for-classification-tasks-142fdfdc87d6

##### Data preprocessing
Data Preprocessing is a Data Mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format According to Techopedia.
