# Classification
I know there's alot of blogs and acticles about what classification problem is in machine learning.  
this read me won't compite with those acticle to drive the best way you could understand classification but contribute to those acticle to give you options.  
Am not a writer and I don't expect to write the best piece but I promise i will try my best for your option collections.
Classification problem in machine learning is when you are trying to predict a class or label in a given dataset.  
A good example of Classification problem is this repo. the provided data has a class if a given patient has a diabetes undertand outcome column given what feaures  
could contribute the "outcome".

### Real Life Problem
is many cases the client you're working for or the project you're working on expect you to label the columns and identify the problem statement on your own.  
I know many Love advice will say follow your heart and don't let you head get in the way, well this is the opposite.  
But don't worry when a client expect you to define the problem statement you've already above the data science label and it will be a piece of cake.  
For those who are finding hard to grasp don't worry I will walk you though this repo.
